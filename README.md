### Land-Cover-Project
#### Classification Model Development

#### Overview
This project focuses on building a classification model through comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and develop an effective predictive model.

#### Features
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Handling Missing Values and Data Imputation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Model Training, Tuning, and Evaluation

#### Installation
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running:
```bash
pip install pandas geopandas numpy matplotlib seaborn labelencoder optuna catboost 
```

#### Usage
1. Load and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
3. Engineer and select features to enhance model performance.
4. Train various classification models and compare their performance.
5. Evaluate the models using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Results

The final model is implemented using CatBoost, which provides robust performance and improved classification accuracy by handling categorical features efficiently and reducing overfitting.
